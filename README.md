# Semantic-Similarity

An intelligent system that learns and computes the synonym of a word given a list of alternatives.

The system utilizes specified .txt files in the 'learning' folder to learn and build relationships between words by counting how many times they appear in a sentence.
Using semantic descriptor vectors, the system would compute the cosine similarity between descriptor vectors of the word and each of the alternatives.

This program utilizes simple machine learning concepts to achieve success with its functionality.
